# Coding Challenges Hub

This repository is a centralized hub designed to consolidate various coding challenges and algorithmic problem-solving records that were previously scattered. It encompasses everything from personal skill-building to team-based challenges conducted through the organization.

## 🧩 Structure(Submodule)

This repository integrates independent challenge projects as Git submodules:

- solveit
- co-coding-challenges

## 💻 Language

- JavaScript

## 🚀 Goals

- Enhance problem-solving capabilities by tackling a diverse range of coding challenges.
- Establish a consistent habit of solving and documenting problems to reinforce learning.
- Systematically record the logic and data structures utilized in each solution.

## 🔗 Extensions Used

To streamline the documentation process, this repository is integrated with the following extensions for automatic synchronization:

- [BaekjoonHub](https://github.com/BaekjoonHub/BaekjoonHub) – Automatically commits solutions from [Baekjoon Online Judge](https://www.acmicpc.net/)
- [LeetHub2](https://github.com/CQCode/LeetHub2) – Automatically commits solutions from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

> Note: Auto-committed files are pushed to the `main` branch under the respective directories (e.g., `baekjoon/`, `leetcode/`, `프로그래머스/`).

<!--
